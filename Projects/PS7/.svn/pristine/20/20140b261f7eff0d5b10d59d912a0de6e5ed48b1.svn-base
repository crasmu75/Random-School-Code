	/// <summary> 
	/// A StringSocket is a wrapper around a Socket.  It provides methods that
	/// asynchronously read lines of text (strings terminated by newlines) and 
	/// write strings. (As opposed to Sockets, which read and write raw bytes.)  
	///
	/// StringSockets are thread safe.  This means that two or more threads may
	/// invoke methods on a shared StringSocket without restriction.  The
	/// StringSocket takes care of the synchonization.
	/// 
	/// Each StringSocket contains a Socket object that is provided by the client.  
	/// A StringSocket will work properly only if the client refrains from calling
	/// the contained Socket's read and write methods.
	/// 
	/// If we have an open Socket s, we can create a StringSocket by doing
	/// 
	///    StringSocket ss = new StringSocket(s, new UTF8Encoding());
	/// 
	/// We can write a string to the StringSocket by doing
	/// 
	///    ss.BeginSend("Hello world", callback, payload);
	///    
	/// where callback is a SendCallback (see below) and payload is an arbitrary object.
	/// This is a non-blocking, asynchronous operation.  When the StringSocket has 
	/// successfully written the string to the underlying Socket, or failed in the 
	/// attempt, it invokes the callback.  The parameters to the callback are a
	/// (possibly null) Exception and the payload.  If the Exception is non-null, it is
	/// the Exception that caused the send attempt to fail.
	/// 
	/// We can read a string from the StringSocket by doing
	/// 
	///     ss.BeginReceive(callback, payload)
	///     
	/// where callback is a ReceiveCallback (see below) and payload is an arbitrary object.
	/// This is non-blocking, asynchronous operation.  When the StringSocket has read a
	/// string of text terminated by a newline character from the underlying Socket, or
	/// failed in the attempt, it invokes the callback.  The parameters to the callback are
	/// a (possibly null) string, a (possibly null) Exception, and the payload.  Either the
	/// string or the Exception will be non-null, but nor both.  If the string is non-null, 
	/// it is the requested string (with the newline removed).  If the Exception is non-null, 
	/// it is the Exception that caused the send attempt to fail.
