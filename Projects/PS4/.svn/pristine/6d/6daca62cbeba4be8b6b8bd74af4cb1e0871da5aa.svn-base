I definitely need to write a Class. Not just because I will be using it
later, but I don't see a way to implement the Spreadsheet class without
a Cell class!

I've worked with the GUI in Visual Studio before and I'm guessing that 
the cells are going to hold strings. So for now I've decided that I'm
going to have the cell class constructor accept strings for the contents.
Within the constructor I will have it try parsing for double and then
see if the string begins with an equals sign (it will be a Formula then).
