I definitely need to write a Cell Class. Not just because I will be 
using it later, but I don't see a way to implement the Spreadsheet 
class without a Cell class!

I've worked with the GUI in Visual Studio before and I'm guessing that 
the cells are going to hold strings. I know that at some point in the 
future I'm going to have to check to see whether the contents are a 
double, string, or Formula, because I have a different method in my
Spreadsheet class for each one...

When am I going to erase the = sign in front of the Formula? I'm 
assuming that's what I'll be using to determine whether or not its a
Formula. (Because the Formula could be a load of balogna and then it'd 
throw a FormulaFormatException like it should)
