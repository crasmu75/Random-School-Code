I definitely need to write a Cell Class. Not just because I will be 
using it later, but I don't see a way to implement the Spreadsheet 
class without a Cell class!

I've worked with the GUI in Visual Studio before and I'm guessing that 
the cells are going to hold strings. I know that at some point in the 
future I'm going to have to check to see whether the contents are a 
double, string, or Formula, because I have a different method in my
Spreadsheet class for each one...

When am I going to erase the = sign in front of the Formula? I'm 
assuming that's what I'll be using to determine whether or not its a
Formula. (Because the Formula could be a load of balogna and then it'd 
throw a FormulaFormatException like it should)

Ok so I noticed that I implemented way more than I was supposed to.
I guess I will have a bit of an easier time on my next assignment.
However, I don't know what kind of exceptions to throw in my LookupCell
Value method because for some reason it won't throw ArgumentExceptions.
It's the weirdest thing, I can't figure it out for the life of me!
So for now it just throws InvalidNameExceptions. I will have to fix it 
later.

I wanted to implement the part of the program that actually recalculates
the dependent cells when a cell is updated, but that will have to wait.
I'm running out of time.
