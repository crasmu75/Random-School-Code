Upon starting this project we are still trying to debug our StringSocket project. We may 
end up having to use the provided dll to ensure proper performace from the StringSocket
side of things.

Today ended up being all about fixing our PS7 and looking over the ChatServerAndClient 
example project from the lab a few weeks back.

Completing all instances of the server receiving commands from the clients. We decided upon
creating a new class for Game objects to keep information local to each individual game
that is between two clients. (We use StringSockets to identify them.)

Confused on the callback syntax used in the ChatServerAndClient example, but we will just
use it for now. Plan on asking the TA's on Monday.

Testing?? How do we test??

Having a hard time with updating the time. I think we've decided upon having the time field
be local to the Game class because every game need's it's own time. How to update this every
second?

TODO on Monday/Tuesday - 

~File reading for the Games' dictionaries of legal words.
~Finish the constructor to deal with 3 input parameters
~Sending out START command and all 3 of it's followers
~Sending out TIME command
~When time expires and sending out STOP command
~TERMINATE command - try catch block?
~Write a simple GUI client for testing.
