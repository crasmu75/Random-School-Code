Formula Changes -
	Token Parser: one or more letters followed by one or more digits

Spreadsheet things to remember -
	Checking for valid names: check isValid delegate from AbstractSpreadsheet
	Whenever you are given a cell name - normalize it before doing anything
		else with it
	Formula Parameter: replace n with Normalize(n)  ??? maybe do this
		-->decided against
	3rd constructor: open file from file name
		-->done Oct 16

Bugs -
	Variable validation in Formula class... change?
	bool Changed for formulas
	ABC7 = abc7 ?
	***GetCellsToRecalculate - when to call??
		-->done Oct 15
	Multiple dependents with Formula Errors - test

Don't forget to test -
	invalid cell name: violates parser rules
	invalid cell name: violates isValid function (just true or false)
	1st constructor - check this.IsValid this.Normalize, this.Version
	2nd constructor - check all these things with a couple different inputs
	Test for formula errors...
	***Test GetCellValue & GetCellContents on cells that haven't been referenced
		yet
	Test 4-parameter constructor with different version names
	Test getVersion on that and some others
