How would you change query to get all the Book info?


was:

     select * from Books

     dataset.Add(new Book(1, 1, false, reader["Title"] as String, reader["Author"] as String));

change to:

     SELECT * FROM Books	natural	join Catalog;

     dataset.Add(new Book((int)reader["SerialNum"], (int)reader["ISBN"],  false, reader["Title"] as String, reader["Author"] as String));
