Selenium is a fantastic tool that I now understand and enjoy using.
This Selenium project I wrote is well commented, however I will explain the process here in the README.

I realized the most annoying parts of the website to test by hand were the ones that required input, especially if there was some sort of data-validation included, because that would require several different scenarios of input. Therefore, in my C# program I first navigated to Assignment 7 and to the registration page and tested that page with several different inputs. I then went to the login page and tested it with incorrect username/password pair, then with the one I’d just created in order to login. Next, I navigated to submitting an application, and entered some random information into it (which by hand this would take a lot longer.) I had the program click submit upon several errors in the data, then once at the end when everything was valid. Last, I had the program view the application it had just submitted.

Throughout the program I have checkpoints, and the console will print out once it is done with that particular ’test’. During the fourth ‘test’ (viewing the submitted application) the program will run through and make sure all the information matches what it had entered earlier.

I spent around 8 hours on this assignment (with little setup time taken) so I stopped at an appropriate place. However, I can expand this test by submitting more applications and making sure the latest one shows up when they choose ‘View Latest Application’, or even have the program register as an administrator and view a classes applied TA’s to see if the applicants show up that we had choose that class on their application. We could also test the AJAX on that page somehow to see if the status of the applicant actually changes when we choose it.

Again, I tested the main parts of the website that require most manual input from a user, so we could quickly automate it in order to get it tested.
