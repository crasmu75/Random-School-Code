Monday 12/8 -- 3 hrs
Today we set up the tables in our database and set up the connection.
We had to run several updates on MySQL Workbench so this step took a little longer than expected.

Wednesday 12/10 -- 4 hrs
Today we modified our server to send data to our tables in teh database.
We wrote 3 helper methods, each of which could send a command to insert data into one of the three tables
we had set up. These helper methods were called each time we sent right after the game ended, before the
final data was sent to the client. As we collected the lists of words for the final game summary we sent that
data to the database. This might not be the most efficient way, but it worked and we will go back later to modify
if time allows. Now that we are writing to the database correctly we need to focus on sending the html.
